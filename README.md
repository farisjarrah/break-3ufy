# break-3ufy
Teardown of some eufy security hardware.

## Plan
* Document and reverse engineer the eufy security hardware ecosystem to discover the capability of the hardware and see if it can be repurposed.

## Strategy
* Phase 1: Breakdown and document all of the hardware
* Phase 2: Figure out how to get root on the homebase
* Phase 3: Figure out how to get root on the camera
* Phase 4: Figure out how to communicate with keypad
* Phase 5: Figure out how to communicate with motion and entry sensors

## Tear Downs:
* Eufy Homebase 2
  * Back side of board - QR code on the board and silk-screened code on the board blanked out until I understand what they are and do. There was also a heat pad covering the two F790 chips on the left side of the image
